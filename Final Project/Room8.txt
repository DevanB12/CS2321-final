You see a light at the end of the tunnel shining from above.
You climb up the latter to find that you have stumbled into an 
abandoned barn, at least you thought it was until you notice
that there is a chained up dog laying in the corner sleeping.
Looks like a couple of owlet's were devoured by that dog as
as there are a couple of wings still on the ground around
the dog, kind of feel bad for the birds...
